# Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench

# Summary
MySQL queries assessed stock post-orders. Warehouse B has the most products and the lowest turnover, and the Ford Mustang is the top-selling classic car.


# Solution
Given that Warehouse B holds the most inventory, the highest post-sales stock percentage, and the lowest turnover, we can facilitate warehouse closure by:


1. Running promotions or offering discounts on remaining classic cars to boost sales.

2. Transferring excess stock to other warehouses.

3. Prioritizing the top-selling '1968 Ford Mustang' to maintain availability, optimize stock levels, and prevent stockouts.


# Approach
MySQL was used to examine the total number of warehouses, their respective products and product lines. A deeper dive involved analyzing available stock and their percentages, utilizing SQL joins to assess remaining stock post-successful orders. Inventory turnover in each warehouse was investigated, revealing that Warehouse B holds the highest stock, stock percentage and the lowest turnover among all four warehouses. Further SQL joins within Warehouse B unveiled the top-selling product
